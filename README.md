# coding_challenges
My solutions to coding challenges I complete online.

1. sentence_spinner.py
    from: codewars.com
    Instructions:
    Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name
    of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

    Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is      
    another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
    
2. min_max_codewars.py 
   Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy    and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

    Task
    Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

3. validate_pin.py
    ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

    If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.
    
4. remove-smallest.py
    The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring           exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

    However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items     after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

    Task
    Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one    with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

    Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
