My solutions to coding challenges I complete online.

1. sentence_spinner.py
    from: codewars.com
    Instructions:
    Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name
    of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

    Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is      
    another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
