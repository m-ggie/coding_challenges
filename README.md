# coding_challenges
My solutions to coding challenges I complete online.

1. sentence_spinner.py
    from: codewars.com
    Instructions:
    Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name
    of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

    Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is      
    another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
    
2. min_max_codewars.py 
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.
